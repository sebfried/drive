# Drive - Endless Racer

A simple endless driving game built with Three.js and Vite.

## Overview

This project was created as a weekend experiment, primarily to explore development workflows using [Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) for managing tasks within an AI-assisted coding environment (Cursor).

The game itself is a basic endless runner where the player dodges oncoming and same-direction traffic.

## Tech Stack

*   **Engine:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
*   **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
*   **Task Management:** [Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)
*   **Language:** JavaScript

## Running the Project

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Run development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server.

3.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```
    This creates a production-ready build in the `docs/` directory (configured for GitHub Pages).

4.  **Preview production build:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run preview
    ```
    This serves the contents of the `docs/` directory locally.

## Notes

*   This is primarily an experimental project focused on the development process with AI tools.
*   Game features and polish may be limited.
